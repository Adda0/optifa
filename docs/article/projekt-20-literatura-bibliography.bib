Decidability of this general logic is still open. Our procedure is sound for the general logic, and a decision procedure for a particularly rich fragment that restricts the form in which word equations are written. In contrast to many existing procedures, our method does not make assumptions about the maximum length of words. We have developed a prototypical implementation of our decision procedure, and integrated it into a CEGAR-based model checker for the analysis of programs encoded as Horn clauses. Our tool is able to automatically establish the correctness of several programs that are beyond the reach of existing methods.",

The majority of string constraint solvers rely on finite automata to support regular expression constraints. For these approaches, performance depends critically on fast automata operations such as intersection, complementation, and determinization.

The efficiency of our new algorithms is illustrated by experimental results.}

abstract="We present a novel length-aware solving algorithm for the quantifier-free first-order theory over regex membership predicate and linear arithmetic over string length. We implement and evaluate this algorithm and related heuristics in the Z3 theorem prover. A crucial insight that underpins our algorithm is that real-world regex and string formulas contain a wealth of information about upper and lower bounds on lengths of strings, and such information can be used very effectively to simplify operations on automata representing regular expressions. Additionally, we present a number of novel general heuristics, such as the prefix/suffix method, that can be used to make a variety of regex solving algorithms more efficient in practice. We showcase the power of our algorithm and heuristics via an extensive empirical evaluation over a large and diverse benchmark of 57256 regex-heavy instances, almost 75{\%} of which are derived from industrial applications or contributed by other solver developers. Our solver outperforms five other state-of-the-art string solvers, namely, CVC4, OSTRICH, Z3seq, Z3str3, and Z3-Trau, over this benchmark, in particular achieving a speedup of 2.4{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}over CVC4, 4.4{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}over Z3seq, 6.4{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}over Z3-Trau, 9.1{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}over Z3str3, and 13{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}over OSTRICH.",
